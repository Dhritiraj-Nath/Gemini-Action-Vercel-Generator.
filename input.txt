This project uses Gemini and GitHub Actions to create a fully automated, serverless content generation pipeline. When a developer pushes a simple text file, the AI transforms the raw text into a professional, structured JSON output, and Vercel deploys the updated content to a live, professional UI. It's a great showcase for automation skills.
